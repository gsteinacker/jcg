Release 0.1: Basics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID      Prio    Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
00        1     Implemented the basics of jcg.
01        1     Change the transformation process, so primarily types are transformed, not models.
                ModelTransformer => TypeTransformer.
02        1     Defined some jcg annotations to configure the transformation process: Mutable,
                Immutable define the transformation in order to make generated classes (im)mutable.
                In addition to that, TransformWith was introduced. This annotation selects a
                configurable transformer chain to transform the annotated class.
10        1     Implemented method bodies, including the generation of setter, getter
                and constructor bodies. Open issue: the bodies generated by AddGetters and so on
                is using fully qualified names (java.util.Collections, ...) because otherwise the
                code would not be compilable. This has to be changed in the future, because the
                code is ugly this way... (see #64)
12        1     Implemented a FileGenerator
14        3     Refactored Rules, removed Predicates.
18        3     Added support for (well, nearly...) all kinds of annotation-parameter values.
19        1     Implemented initialization of fields and constants.
                Open issue: initilization blocks (static and non-static) are not yet implemented
                (see #26).
60        3     Parsing method bodies. In contrast to issue 01, method bodies are not only part of
                the model and generated by the templates, but also parsed by the parser. This is
                a prerequisite for merging generated code with manipulated code.
                Open Issue: types used in the body are not yet imported (see #67)
